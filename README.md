# Community Opencloud Helm Chart

Welcome to the **Opencloud Helm Chart** repository! This repository is intended as a community-driven space for developing and maintaining Helm charts for deploying OpenCloud on Kubernetes.
**Community Maintained** This repository is **community-maintained** and **not officially supported by OpenCloud GmbH**. Use at your own risk, and feel free to contribute to improve the project!

## 🚀 About

This repository is created to **welcome contributions from the community**. It does not contain official charts from OpenCloud GmbH and is **not officially supported by OpenCloud GmbH**. Instead, these charts are maintained by the open-source community.

OpenCloud is a cloud collaboration platform that provides file sync and share, document collaboration, and more. This Helm chart deploys OpenCloud with the **integrated identity manager (IDM)** by default — no external Keycloak, PostgreSQL, or MinIO required. Collabora (document editing) is bundled. Optionally, external OIDC (Keycloak, Auth0, etc.), external S3 storage, and ClamAV virus scanning can be configured.

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes 1.33+
- Helm 3.18.0+
- PV provisioner support in the underlying infrastructure (if persistence is enabled)
- Gateway API compatible ingress controller (e.g., Cilium Gateway) for HTTPS routing

## 📦 Available Charts

This repository contains the following charts:

### Production Chart (`charts/opencloud`)

The complete OpenCloud deployment:

- OpenCloud with integrated IDM (default) or external OIDC
- Collabora for document editing
- PVC-backed storage (posixfs/decomposed) or external S3
- Optional: ClamAV virus scanning, OPA policies, external LDAP user management

## 📜 License

This project is licensed under the **AGPLv3** license. See the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for more details.

## ⚡ Quick Start

Deploy OpenCloud with the integrated IDM (no external Keycloak, PostgreSQL, or MinIO) in a single `helm install`. Works out of the box with a Gateway API-compatible ingress controller (e.g., Cilium Gateway).

```bash
# Navigate to the chart directory first
cd /path/to/helm-repo/charts/opencloud

# Then run the installation command
helm install opencloud . \
  --namespace opencloud \
  --create-namespace \
  --set httpRoute.enabled=true \
  --set httpRoute.gateway.name=cilium-gateway \
  --set httpRoute.gateway.namespace=kube-system \
  --set httpRoute.gateway.sectionName=opencloud
```

Verify the deployment:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n opencloud
```

Uninstall (PVCs are retained by Helm to preserve data — delete them manually if you want a clean slate):

```bash
helm uninstall opencloud -n opencloud
# Optional: drop retained PVCs
kubectl -n opencloud delete pvc -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=opencloud
```

> **Note:** Never delete the namespace — only use `helm uninstall` (or delete the HelmRelease if using Flux). This ensures PVCs always stay.

For deploying the full stack with FluxCD (external Keycloak, OpenLDAP, ClamAV), see the [chart documentation](./charts/opencloud/README.md) — self-contained HelmReleases live in `charts/opencloud/deployments/flux/`.

1. **Install the OpenCloud Helm chart:**
  ```sh
  helm install opencloud \
    oci://ghcr.io/tim-herbie/opencloud-helm/opencloud \
    --version 1.0.0 \
    --namespace opencloud \
    --create-namespace
  ```
